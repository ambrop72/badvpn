# This file contains some examples of using NCD, the Network Configuration Daemon.
#
# A short introduction to NCD follows.
#
# NCD is a general-purpose system configuration system, operated with a unique programming language.
# The configuration consists of one or more so-called processes that can be considered executing in
# parallel. Further, each process consists of one or more statements, representing the individual
# actions. Statements are implemented as modules built into NCD.
#
# Inside a process, statements can be considered "executed" one after another. That is, when NCD
# starts up, it initializes the first statement, putting it in the DOWN state. When the statement
# reports having transitioned into the UP state, it initializes the next statement in the DOWN state,
# and so on.
#
# However, execution can go in the other direction too. A statement in the UP state can, at any time,
# report having transitioned into the DOWN state. At this point, any statements after that one will
# automatically be de-initialized. The de-initiazation is done from the bottom up. First the last
# initialized statement after the problematic statement is requested to terminate and enters the
# DYING state. After it terminates, its preceding statement enters the DYING state, and so on, until
# all statements following the problematic statement have been de-initiazed.
#
# The backward-execution is the key feature of NCD, and is particularly well suited for programming
# system configurations. Read on to see why.
#
# Statements in NCD can be divided into two categories:
#   - Statements that configure something. These statements transition into the UP state "immediately".
#     On de-initialization, such statements perform the reverse operation of what they did when initialized.
#     Imaginary example: a statement that turn a light on intialization, and turns if off on de-initialization.
#   - Statements that wait for something. These statements may remain in the DOWN state indefinitely.
#     They enter the UP state when the waited-for condition is satisfied, and also go back into the DOWN
#     state when it is no longer satisfied.
#     Imaginary example: a statement that is UP when a switch is turned on, and DOWN when it is turned off.
#
# Using the two example statements, we can constuct a process that controls the light based on the switch:
# (these are not really implemented in NCD :)
#
#  process light {
#      wait_switch();
#      turn_light();
#  }
#
# When the switch is turned on, wait_switch() will transition to UP, initializing turn_light(), turning the
# light on. When the switch is turned off, wait_switch() will transition to DOWN, causing the de-initialization
# of turn_light(), turning the light off.
# We can add another turn_light() at the end to make the switch control two lights.
#
# A more complex example: We have a christmas three with lights on it. There are multiple "regular" lights,
# controlled with switches, and a special "top" light. The regular lights take a long time to turn on, and
# each takes a different, unpredictable time. We want the top light to be turned on if and only if all the regular
# lights are completely on.
#
# This problem can easily be solved using dependencies. NCD has built-in support for dependencies, provided
# in the form of provide() and depend() statements. A depend() statement is DOWN when its corresponding
# provide() statement is not initialized, and UP when it is. When a provide() is requested to de-initialize, it
# transitions the depend() statements back into the DOWN state, and, before actually dying, waits for any
# statements following them to de-initialize.
#
# The christmas three problem can then be programmed as follows:
#
# process light1 {
#     wait_switch1();
#     turn_light1();
#     provide("L1");
# }
#
# process light2 {
#     wait_switch2();
#     turn_light2();
#     provide("L2");
# }
#
# process top_light {
#     depend("L1");
#     depend("L2");
#     turn_top_light();
# }
#
# Follow some real examples of network configuration using NCD.
# For a list of implemented statements and their descriptions, take a look at the BadVPN source code, in
# the ncd/modules/ folder.
